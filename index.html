            <p>
              From Yarmouth to Sydney, Nova Scotia is full of scenic landscapes,
              rich history, and interesting local culture. Sights and fun
              experiences abound in Nova Scotia, and there is a little bit of
              something for everyone. Soak up the beauty and serenity to be
              found in the Annapolis Royal Historic Gardens, or head to Cape
              Breton Highlands National Park for the stunning landscape and
              wildlife. Explore the history of the area at Fortress of
              Louisbourg National Historic Site, or hike the Skyline Trail.

                <p>
                  A former rum running and ship building port town, and a UNESCO
                  World Heritage Site, postcard-perfect Lunenburg is a fishing
                  village of brightly painted British Colonial buildings built
                  in the 1750s, about 60 kilometres from Halifax. Lunenburg is
                  now a charming, walkable town, and a must-stop on any trip to
                  Nova Scotia.

                <h4>Peggy's Cove</h4>
                <p>
                  Peggy‚Äôs Cove is famed for its picturesque and typically
                  East-Coast profile, with houses perched along a narrow inlet
                  and on wave-washed boulders facing the Atlantic. Although this
                  unique environment has been designated a preservation area, it
                  is still an active fishing community.

                <p>
                  The waters off Brier Island and the Bay of Fundy are the
                  summer feeding ground, nursery and play area for dozens of
                  marine species, including whales, dolphins, seabirds and a
                  colony of seals. Brier Island Whale and Seabird Cruises is one
                  of the longest running whale watching companies in Nova
                  Scotia.

          <h4>About me</h4>
          <p>
            I've visited the East coast of Canada several times in my life. I've
            always dreamed of living there with my partner and our future
            children. There is so much opportunity to hike and explore the
            beautiful landscape, and plenty of good food to try. There's no
            place that makes me more calm and happy.
